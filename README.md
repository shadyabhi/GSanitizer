# GSanitizer

All the links that you open on Google.com are opened after getting redirected via Google.com so that Google can keep track of what you open. This slows down the process as it adds a redirection on each click. This extension removes that redirection.

This extension uses [kango framework](http://kangoextensions.com/) to build extensions for Firefox, Chrome and Safari.
